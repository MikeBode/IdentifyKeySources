# IdentifyKeySources

This project contains the code and data required to recreate the figures and results from the Formal Comment draft manuscript: Resilient reefs may exist - can numerical larval dispersal models find them? By Michael Bode, Lance Bode, Severine Choukroun, Maurice James, and Luciano Mason, submitted to PLoS Biology.

The analyses are best understood through the central Matlab code, found in "Compare_KeySources.m". This code:
- Extracts the data from the two biophysical models from .MAT files. 
- Analyses the set of connectivity matrices generated by model A, and chooses Key Sources based on the criteria outlined in Hock et al. (2017). It also calculates the "worst sources", by inverting the Hock et al. criteria.
- Compares the key sources identified by the two biophysical models to identify overlap.
- Outputs key results in the command prompt, and generates a TIFF figure corresponding to Figure 1 from the comment.
