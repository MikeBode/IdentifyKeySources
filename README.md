# IdentifyKeySources

This project contains the code and data required to recreate the figures and results from the response article: 
Resilient reefs may exist - can numerical larval dispersal models find them?
by Michael Bode, Lance Bode, Severine Choukroun, Maurice James, and Luciano Mason
Submitted to PLoS Biology

Matlab code can be found in "Compare_KeySources.m". 
This code extracts data from the .mat files, and outputs key results in the command prompt, and in a TIFF figure.
